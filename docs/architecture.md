# xOS Architecture

## ðŸ“š Context
We're building **xOS** â€” an event-driven, AI-powered operating system for xLAB.

Architecture to keep in mind (for later phases):
- **/services/**
  â€¢ events-gateway   â†’ Fastify server that ingests webhooks (Gmail, Zoho, Wio Bankâ€¦).  
  â€¢ quote-wizard     â†’ Worker that turns briefs into Zoho quotes/invoices.  
  â€¢ payment-reconcileâ†’ Worker that polls Wio transactions and marks Zoho invoices paid.  

- **/packages/**
  â€¢ shared-prompt    â†’ Prompt templates & utility functions.  
  â€¢ vector-brain     â†’ pgvector helper to store & query embeddings.  

- **/apps/**
  â€¢ dashboard-next   â†’ Next.js + shadcn/ui HUD (Kanban, metrics, notifications).

Tech stack: **pnpm workspaces Â· TypeScript Â· Prisma Â· Postgres (+ pgvector) Â· Node 20 Â· Docker**.
