Snapshot of the repo right now

Item	Status
Prisma removed from code base	❌ — package.json still lists prisma and @prisma/client; Prisma CLI is still in node_modules.
Prisma schema file deleted	✅ infra/schema.prisma is gone.
Drizzle migrations committed	✅ /drizzle/0000_supreme_sleeper.sql exists.
Root pnpm dev alias	❌ not in root package.json.
Docker logic stripped from scripts/dev.js	✅ no Docker checks remain.
README quick-start	❌ file doesn’t exist yet.
docs/architecture.md updated	⚠️ present, but still says “Tech stack: … Prisma …” and has no diagram.
Lint passes	not test-run yet.

So you knocked out about half of the clean-up list—nice!
Two blockers remain before we tag phase-0-ok and move to the quote-wizard sprint.

⸻

1. Finish the clean-up (5-10 min)

a) Purge Prisma completely

pnpm remove prisma @prisma/client

Then delete any lingering Prisma references in package.json scripts or elsewhere (search for prisma).

b) Add the dev & lint aliases

package.json (root)

"scripts": {
  "dev": "node scripts/dev.js",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts"
}

c) README

Create README.md at root:

## xOS – Phase 0

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev             # Boots events-gateway on port 5000 (Replit PORT env when hosted)
curl $PORT/health    # → { "status": "ok" }

### d) docs/architecture.md touch-up

* Replace “Prisma” with **Drizzle**.  
* Add this quick directory sketch:

/services
├─ events-gateway         # API layer
├─ quote-wizard           # (next phase)
└─ payment-reconcile      # (later)
/packages
├─ shared-prompt
└─ vector-brain
/apps
└─ dashboard-next
/infra           # docker-compose, drizzle config

---

## 2. Sanity check

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                 # server runs, no Prisma warnings
curl localhost:5000/health   # { "status": "ok" }
drizzle-kit status           # 0 pending migrations
pnpm lint                    # exit 0

When those four commands succeed, commit & push, then:

git tag phase-0-ok
git push --tags

3. Green-light for Phase 1

Once the tag is live, paste the Phase 1 prompt I gave earlier into the Replit Agent to build /services/quote-wizard (Zoho draft generator).

If you hit any hiccups finishing the clean-up, drop the error or link and I’ll troubleshoot before we advance. 🚀
